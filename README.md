# Snake Game
 
This is a simple and easy project that is made with python language using object orientation programming and libraries 'Turtle' also known as turtle graphics to build the classic Snake Game
I have created multiple files and defined multiple classes in each file and imported these classes onto the main.py file
Run the main.py file to play the game
If the code is analyzed you can make changes to the game such as the speed of the snake, the colour of the food, the size of the snake etc.......
